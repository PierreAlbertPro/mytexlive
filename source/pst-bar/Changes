pst-bar.tex -------------------
 v 0.92   2008/11/26
    move the key handling to the extended xkeyval package (hv)
    
 v 0.91   2008/04/16
    Bar labels now set within parboxes to keep them from becoming too
    long or overlapping with neighboring labels. New keys
    ``labelalign'' and ``labelwidth'' added to control this behavior.
    WARNING: These new features are not yet fully tested!

 v 0.9    2005/10/07
    Code now uses pst-xkey instead of pst-keyval for managing keys.

 v 0.8    2005/02/13
    Adjusted the code for stacked bar styles so the Postscript code argument to
    \psbarscale so the Postscript code is only applied to the bottom bar.

 v 0.7a   2004/09/24
    Removed some debugging code that was accidentally left in the last release.
    The removed code was harmless, but caused confusion for some users.

 v 0.7    2004/09/15
    Made a minor change to \psbarscale so its functionality would be more
    closely analogous to the \pstScale command from the pstricks-add pacakge.
    Improved documentation. Set default barstyle to list of all available
    barstyles. First release to CTAN.

 v 0.6    2004/09/09
    Added orientation parameter and horizontal bar-drawing capability. Removed
    erroneous correction factor for linewidth from stacked bar chart.

 v 0.5    2004/09/02
    Added header parameter for \readpsbardata. Improved handling of headers in
    the data file -- spaces may now be included in a header item, though commas
    still may not.

 v 0.4    2004/08/29
    Added "block" chartstyle. Updated \readpsbardata to use .csv for both
    header and data. Introduced \psbarscale command. First release to pstricks
    mailing list, 2004/09/01.

 v 0.3    2004/08/26
    Added command \readpsbardata to read data for bar chart directly from a
    .csv file with the first row containing the column labels.

 v 0.2a   2004/08/23
    Changed colsep parameter name to barcolsep to avoid clash with psmatrix.

 v 0.2    2004/08/22
    Added stacked bar chart, chartstyle parameter, and introduced pst-bar.pro
    prologue with transpose command.

 v 0.1    2004/08/21
    Clustered bar chart.
